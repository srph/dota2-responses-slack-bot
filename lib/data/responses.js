That one's for you, Morty, cuz you like bad jokes."," Man, I'm confused, Rick. You know, on one hand, she's a deer, but on the other hand she's a hell of a woman. Yeah I don't know what to do Morty, take her out to dinner, or take her out and eat her at dinner, you know what I’m saying? Venison. Yeah! Ha ha! We did it!"," You know Morty I know you like black holes, but try to keep it together over there. Yeah, I do like black holes, they're really cool."," If you need some headlights, you could just grab his eyeballs out."," They call him Faceless Void but he does have at least a mouth."," Where's the passenger seat, Morty. What if this guy wanted to take someone on a date? Good luck."," I see we got an armchair inventor over here. Not bad."," Hey what do you know Rick. This guy built a ship just like you did out of spare parts. You guys are in the same league. This thing couldn't even leave the atmosphere, Morty."," This looks like your gym guy at the gym who's trying to one-up- The hell would you know about a gym, Morty. Your arm's about the size of my finger."," All you're gonna invoke is your ineptitude at your ability to handle a keyboard."," I don't know why anybody would pick this guy. He's impossible to play. Good luck. What are you, a veteran?"," Yeah, boy, look at you mister fancy pants, picking this guy. Good luck you loser."," What? He's just a ball that floats around. He doesn't even talk. Yeah, but you know what he does do, Rick? He helps people."," You know Rick, this is the one character in the game I relate to the most. Why? Because nobody can understand a word he's saying?"," Hey this guy'd be cool to have at a barbecue, because he could heat up the grill, and then he could plop a few ice cubes in your drink. Couldn't have said it better myself, Morty."," You know, I gotta say I really like the style of this guy's mask. Yeah, but you gotta wonder: what's he hiding under there."," Hey Morty, what do you think is under that mask? I bet you just a blank nub."," You know, this guy looks all buff and crazy, but let's be honest. Underneath that mask he probably has a nice, dainty little pixie face."," Hey Rick, you think this guy's got a wife at home? No, obviously. That's why he's such a creep to all the female heroes."," Of all the heroes in the game, I think you're the most like this guy. W-why? Because you have no idea how to talk to women."," Hey Rick, where are you going? Save my seat, Morty. I hear this guy throws rum around and I'm getting a bunch of receptacles to catch it."," Arr matey. Arr matey!"," Geez, man, what's with all these horse people in this game, huh? Yeah, I don't know Morty. Lot of horse characters, huh?"," How many horse people do you need to put into one game? Am I right?"," Damn, this guy's got so many chains he's straight gangsta."," This guy's a life stealer, but you know what else he stole? What else Morty? My heart."," You think it's on fire all over? You know, like all over her body? Every spot? Why do you ask, Morty?"," You know when you go to hell, the first thing they give you is a giant finger. Well, I guess he has been there then."," Geez, Rick. I never saw anybody who liked bears so much. Really Morty? Have you ever met Bears McBearson? That guy loves bears."," Gotta be careful with a girl who rides a panther. You know what they say about girls who are into panthers? What do they say, Morty? That they're crazy."," Hey Rick, you think this guy could help me train my dogs? Yeah, Morty I bet he could. He looks like a real whisperer."," Hey Rick, you think he's got those dogs house broken? I don't think so, Morty. They look pretty wild."," Oh, this guy's got a reaaaal… Nose on him doesn't he Morty? Yeah he sure does. Got one hell of a nose."," Hey look we got a risoceros over here. What are you talking about? A risoceros? What did you say Morty? I said risoceros, right?"," I guess this means Medusa's public domain, huh? Yeah, I think she's an old timey character from the olden days."," It's probably a good thing that she's ugly because, you know, you're not supposed to look at her, right? Yeah, that's right Morty. You turn to stone, I believe."," Uh oh, Morty. It's the Meeseeks of Dota 2."," Hey Morty, this guy reminds me of you, you wanna know why? Why? Because there's five of them, and I've had five Mortys. That's canon."," It's just her and her dog. Just her and her dog against the world, you know? Morty, clearly that's a tiger. It's not a dog. Oh, wait is that a lion? No it's a wolf."," She's got that girl next door kind of look to her. Yeah, if the girl next door turned invisible, and rode around on a huge tiger or whatever that is."," You know you can't have too much water, Rick. Actually Morty, that's not true. There's a thing called hyper hydration."," Think the only reason they picked this guy is because, sub-consciously, they need to get a shower."," Hey boy Rick, I'm getting an eye-full over here. Morty, back up. Stop looking so closely, Morty."," Hey Rick, you think this guy raps? Because with a name like Nature's Prophet, sounds like a rapper to me. Yeah, a granola bar rapper. Whoooah."," I gotta tell you Morty, if there's one character in this game that needs medical insurance, I think we found him. Yeah Rick, you know, this guy's a real mess."," Boy this beetle's got a one-track mind, and it's all about basketball."," Boy I hope the Knicks win this year or this guy's gonna get piiissed."," Oh Morty, this guy's a great example of how luck is all you need in life. You don't have to be smart."," Hey is this guy in your class at school, Morty? Hey go easy on me, Rick. I'm in a normal class, okay?"," Morty, stay behind me. He can't damage intelligent people."," Hey Morty, is it just me or is this lady all blurry. It's all blurry on me. Nah, it's okay Rick. You got a few more drinks left in ya."," Oh my god, Rick. That bird's on fire. He's on fire. Oh that's horrible. Oh my god, somebody needs to get in there and save him."," Morty this is what happens when people that don't know what they're doing start messing around with portal guns."," Hey Morty, check this guy out. Thinks he knows what he's doing messing with portals and stuff."," Why don't they just let the faerie dragons, y'know, live their life."," Hey Rick, did you know that there were faerie dragons? No, I never knew about that but here we have one, right here. It's a faerie dragon."," I think I just lost my appetite, Rick. Yeah, this guy really makes you think twice about eating meat."," Hey Morty, you know what we all have in common with Pugna? What? We all have skeletons inside of us. Every one of us."," Geez, Rick, this lady's really crazy, you know. She's all dressed all naked and wild and stuff. Yeah, I know Morty. I got dibs."," I like that he's comfortable wearing a dress, you know? Yeah me too Morty. I really gotta give this guy--I really gotta hand it to him."," There's only enough room for one Rick in this game, Morty. And it's me."," Morty, it says right here that he definitely likes to steal things. Oh great, what a Rubick."," He certainly likes to steal things that are, you know, not his. I'm referring to the spells."," Uh oh, we got ourselves a sand character Morty. I don't like sand Rick. I'm getting mad, Rick. Calm down, Morty. It's gonna be alright."," I've got eremikophobia. Google it. I'm freaking out over here."," Oh Morty, you don't want to get locked in one of this guy's holes. You'll get a fine case of PTSD."," Six six six Morty. Hail Satan. Ha ha ha, yeah, hail Satan."," This guy's gonna come after your soul Morty. He's coming after your soul. Oh geez Rick, you gotta protect me, Rick!"," Hey Rick, you know, every game needs a shaman type, you know. You gotta have your shaman."," Hey Morty you know why he's got those boards strapped across his ears like that? Why, Rick? Cuz he's sick of hearing your bullshit, Morty."," I guess taping wood to yourself is better than not having any armor at all. Yeah, you said it Morty."," Whoa Rick, check this guy out! He's got a lot going on for- Silence, Morty!"," Named after the thing I wish I could hear all the time: silence."," Dubba lub nub doo ra ka. Wubba lubba dub dub. Yeah, you said it, Rick."," Nubba lub dub rub. Whoa, Morty. This is a kid's game. Easy."," I think he's trying to catch something with that angler fish nodule on his face. He's trying to catch a break, Morty. Any way he can."," Hey Morty, you know what I like about this guy? He knows when to disappear. You could learn something from him Morty."," Oh geez, who doesn't disappear in this game?"," You know, reminds me of a pet piranha I once had Morty. His name was Roger. It's getting really specific. It's true Morty, it's a whole part of my backstory, I had a pet pirhanna named Roger. He was a good boy."," Hey, geez Rick, why does Santa Claus have all kinds of weapons and bombs and stuff? Because he's pissed Morty. You were a bad boy this year. Santa Claus is real."," Geez Rick, I'm not so sure about this lady. Oh, finally drawing a line in the sand Morty?"," Hey you know what you have in common with this guy, Rick? What's that Morty? You're always breaking my spirit, Rick."," Remember when you said I couldn't fly the ship? Well you broke my spirits on that one. Sorry Morty."," You know Morty, I gotta tell you, you could learn a lot from this character. Just be yourself, Morty. What are you talking about?"," Hey Rick, I can't understand what this guy's talking about. Yeah, Morty. I could make a device that would help me understand what he's saying, but it's beneath me."," He kind of looks sad, you know with those downturned horns and all. Morty, never judge a book by its cover. I saw that guy at a nightclub last weekend, he was going to town."," Oh these are my boys! Yeah! The Techies! Ho ho!"," I used to hang out with guys like these. They knew how to party."," I don't think this guy would ever want to swap health a guy like you, if you catch my drift, oh! I'm in the prime of my life. I'm in the prime of my life, Morty."," Man, you know Morty, if this guy could trade a couple of those tentacles for a neck, he'd really be in business."," The last time I met somebody with this thick of a neck, uh… What? You got a punch line? No. I have a good setup though."," Ah Tinker, we meet again."," Me and Tinker we go way back Morty. What'd he look like before the exoskeleton? Like somebody you'd see at a bar."," Ah, Tinker, you old bastard. You made through the Glarflorpian Wars. Been too long."," Wow! Tinker! He finally finished that exoskeleton he was trying to build."," Hey you know what would be cool, Rick, is if they took this guy and they put him on our front lawn. Think about how nice that would look."," Within the hearts of tiny people lay the hearts of bigger people! Oh, color me inspired, Morty."," This shouldn't be allowed, Rick, a giant walking, talking tree. They gotta draw the line somewhere."," Oh, when is the government going to step in? These genetically modified Os are getting carried away."," You know first it was a little twig, but now look at this thing."," You know Rick, this guy probably had a nice tribe, and a bunch of tribes people. What a waste."," I like this guy's beanie hair. You know, he's got that beanie look. Oh, are they calling it beanie hair?"," If you hang out with this guy, you're gonna sweat flavored snow cone Morty. The hell are you talking about, Rick?"," Yeah, geez, I guess every game has to have a zombie now-a-days, huh?"," I hope I don't end up like this guy, with a bunch of regrets and a giant tombstone."," Morty, I've never seen a more original character. It's a zombie whose got a giant tombstone. And then more zombies come out of that."," Morty if I could hire this guy as a bodyguard, I'd probably never see you again."," How many upset spirits are in this game? Yeah, I know, there's Vengeful Spirit, there's uh, Revenge Spirit, Angry Spirit…"," Geez Rick, this guy looks like one of those types of characters you'd see guarding a ladder in a platformer game. You know what I mean?"," Ooh, it's a snake-type character, Morty. I wonder if it's poisonous."," Oh boy there's a lot of snake people in this game. Yeah you know Rick but you gotta be careful because this snake's got some wings on him, know what I'm saying?"," You know Morty there's a lot of things we could say about Visage, but I think the first thing that comes to mind is… Um… His bracelets. I love those bracelets."," Morty, where do you think he gets all those golems that he's summoning? Yeah, he's taking them away from their families and friends. No wonder they're so pissed."," You know Morty, a lot of western civilization wouldn't want to eat this guy, but I tell ya: it's good protein."," Geez, I wouldn't wanna find something like that under my mattress. That's where I keep this guy. He's under your mattress Morty. I'm not even kidding: look. Oh my god!"," Boy I've never seen a crazy monster wear a tiara before. I guess it's his birthday."," Morty, he may not look it but this is a real doctor. He cured me of my alcoholism. What do you talking about? You're still an alcoholic. What I mean is he made me care less about my alcoholism."," Hey Morty, this guy's beard is making me hungry for a breakfast croissant. Oh jeeze, I see what you mean there."," Mark Twain looks pissed!"," Geez, we got enough horse-based characters to start a whole new Kentucky Derby."," It's hot in here. Is it just me or is it hot in here. Alright, relax Morty."," Hey Morty, why don't we dress up like her and go to a convention. Yeah that sounds like a great idea, Rick!"," This guy loves fire, but I'll tell ya: fire's not a joke."," If he saw me and I was all hurting and stuff, he'd save me. Where are you getting this from?"," You know Rick, I've never been a fan of characters that can just create ghostly, false versions of themselves. It's not cool."," Sometimes it takes seeing a reflection of your own self before you realize how horrible you truly are."," Morty, this is the one guy in the game who's interdimensional, just like us."," Hey, you know when girls say I'm looking for that tall, dark, and handsome? Well, here he is."," That's it, Morty! It's just me and skeletons from here on out. I don't even care anymore."," Man this guy's a real top notch wizard, Morty. Tell you that much."," Yeah, I wouldn't cosplay as this character. No way."," You know what's cool about this guy? What Morty? Nothing. He's the worst. I don't like this one. You blew it."," Man this guy pisses me off Morty. I don't know why. Just pisses me off."," How many characters are in this fricken' game. This is getting to be ridiculous."," Alright! Nice pick."," Why would you pick this guy? He's the worst."," You know, Morty, I wanna say a lot of things about this character, but I'm just going to zip my lip."," That's it, Morty! It's just me and skeletons from here on out. I don't even care anymore."," Why aren't they doing anything? They're just standing around? Relax, Morty."," Oh geez Rick, we're in some real trouble. I know Morty, just follow my lead!"," Huh. Oxygen-rich atmosphere. Giant testicle monsters. We'll be fine. Let's partaaaay!"," What are we here for again? Trying to help these guys win a game? Right, yeah, okay."," 60 seconds. 60 seconds to game start!"," Um. 30 seconds to game start."," Hoo, 30 seconds until th-th-this place goes ham."," Hoo. 30 seconds until the game starts, Rick! I'm getting my things ready Morty."," Oh my god the battle's about to start. Relax! Relax, Morty. C'mere, cuddle in with me."," Morty, don't look now but the battle's about to start!
